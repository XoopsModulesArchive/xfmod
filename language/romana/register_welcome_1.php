<b>Use of Project Account</b>

<p>
<b>Creative Freedom</b>
</p>
<p>
It is our intent to allow you creative freedom on your project. For our legal protection and yours, there are
limits. Details about these restrictions are described in the
Terms of Service.
</p>
<p>
<b>Advertisements</b>
</p>
<p>
You may not place any revenue-generating advertisements on the XOOPS Development Forge website.
</p>
<p>
<b>Open Source/Rights to Code</b>
</p>
<p>
You will be presented with a choice of Open Source approved licenses for
your project. You will still own the code, but these licenses also
allow us to make your code available to the general public. Although you may
choose to stop hosting your project with us at any time, the nature of these licenses
will allow us to continue to make your code available. Details about content
ownership are described in the Terms of Service.
</p>
<p>
If you wish to use another license that is not currently approved by the
Open Source Initiative, let us know and we will review these requests on a
case-by-case basis.
</p>
<p>
It is our intent to provide a permanent home for all versions of your code.
We do reserve the right, however, to terminate your project if there is due
cause, in accordance with the Terms of Service.
