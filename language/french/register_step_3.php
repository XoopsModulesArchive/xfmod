<P>Although the XOOPS Development Forge was created primarily to advance Open Source XOOPS module development using the XOOPS Open source Dynamic Web Content Managment System
we realize the licensing complexities of any Open Source projects.
XOOPS is released under the GNU Gereral Public Licence, and XOOPS Modules are considered `part of the whole applicationÂ´, as they cannot function
without the XOOPS Core. This means that XOOPS Modules MUST be released under a GPL-compatible licence.
<P>To keep things simple, we are relying on the outstanding work
of the <A href="http://www.opensource.org" target="_blank">Open Source Initiative</A>
for our licensing choices. We realize that there may be other licenses out there
that may better fit your needs. If you wish to use a license that is
not OSI Certified, please let us know why you wish to use another
license.
<P>Choosing a license is a serious decision. Please take some time
to read the text (and our explanations) of several licenses before
making a choice about your project.
<P>You may change the license for your project at a
later date, so long as you have a legal capability to do so, your file
release clearly relates this change, and your filemap categorization is
updated appropriately. <i>Please note that license changes are not
retroactive (i.e., do not apply to products already released under
OpenSource license).</i>
<P>The XOOPS Development Forge is not responsible for legal discrepancies regarding
your license.'
