<H3>Create a new tracker</H3>
<P>
You can use this system to track virtually any kind of data, with each 
tracker having separate user, group, category, and permission lists. You 
can also easily move items between trackers when needed.
<P>
Trackers are referred to as 'Artifact Types' and individual pieces of data
are 'Artifacts'. 'Bugs' might be an Artifact Type, whiles a bug report would be
an Artifact. You can create as many Artifact Types as you want, but remember 
you need to set up categories, groups, and permission for each type, which
can get time-consuming.');
