<p>
The XOOPS Development Forge would like to extend an invitation to XOOPS Module Developers to host your
<A href=\"http://www.opensource.org\" target=\"developer\">Open Source</A> development project(s) for no price and with no catch.
</p>
<p><B>The Process</B>
<p>
Registering a XOOPS Module Development project with the XOOPS Development Forge is an easy process, but we do require
a reasonable amount of information in order to automate things
as much as possible and present your project(s) adequately. Registering
project consists of the three steps:
<ol>
<li>Submitting a request
<li>Approval of the request
<li>Setting up your project's account
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Currently, you are going to proceed with the first step of the
process. It should take about 10 minutes. After that, please allow
several days for our review of the request. If it complies
with our requirements for hosting (see the next step), your
project will be approved, and you will receive e-mail
with directions for future steps.
</p>
<p>
During signup, we will present you with some legal documents
regarding your account with us. Please do not
ignore these; they are very important to you and your project.
