provided by $site.  This means that you can browse projects or communities,
read news or forum postings, subscribe to mailing lists, and even download software
without having an account.
<p>When you will want an account is when you desire to participate in the site.
For example, an account may be required before you can submit news or articles, or
before you can post information to forums.
<p>An account is also required if you want to be a member of a community or a project.
Being a member of a community or project means that you have some rights on that community
or project.  For example, you may gain the rights to monitor news submissions, manage
the assignment of enhancement requests, or even modify source code for a project.  Of
course, you do not need membership or an account to simply consume the content of any
community or project.";
