					After installing a Red Carpet client there are three basic steps that you must perform before you can install RPMs from

					<ul>
					<li>Add the Novell Forge Red Carpet service.</li>
					<li>Activate against the project you are interested in by using the project activation key.</li>
					<li>Subscribe to the channel from which you will get files.</li>
					</ul>
					The Forge Red Carpet service is located at https://forgerce.novell.com/data.  The projects
					activation key will be the shortname of the project with '-key' appended to the end (ie. 'forge-key'
					is the activation key for the forge project).  Each project will have a channel with the same name
					as the project's shortname.</p>" . "<p><b>GUI Client Example:</b><br>If you were using the red-carpet GUI client and wanted to install files from the forge project you would do the following:
					<ul>
					<li>On the 'Edit' menu select the 'Services' menu item.
					<li>Click the 'Add Services' button.
					<li>Type in the service url (https://forgerce.novell.com/data), click the 'OK' button and close the 'Edit Services' window.
					<li>On the 'File' menu select the 'Activate' menu item.
					<li>Select the Novell Forge service from the drop down menu.
					<li>Type in your email address.
					<li>Type in the activation key ('forge-key' in our case) and click the 'Activate' button.
					<li>Click on the 'Channels' button.
					<li>Find the channel you want ('forge' in our case), click the check box to select that channel then close the window.
					</ul>Any software published to Red Carpet by the project will now be visable in the 'Available Software' tab.  If you already have the 
					software installed and there is a newer file published, you will find it in the 'Updates' tab.
