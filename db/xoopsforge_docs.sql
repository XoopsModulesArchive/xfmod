Your domain is hosted on\r\na name-based VirtualHost on the main project web server.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;The Apache server is compiled with PHP3/MySQL support and is able to\r\naccess your MySQL database.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;There is a 100MB soft quota for your web site and anonymous FTP directory.\r\n(The high-capacity file server has no limit.)

This allows us to customize certain\r\nprojects on request. The old method of housing several directories\r\nin one CVS tree also led to the mixing of log files and inability\r\nto separate certain parts of projects easily.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;We\'ve made custom changes to the CVS code to allow us to host\r\nthis many CVS Repositories through one access point, and to\r\nclean up the handling of anonymous CVS users.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;We have chosen to allow developers to access the CVS reponsitories\r\nthrough SSH, which the CVS client can easily do by setting one\r\nenvironment variable (and installing SSH).\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;While normally this would open up the CVS box to shell access,\r\nan in-house developed custom shell ensures that only SSH/CVS access\r\nis allowed.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;We open up the repositories for anonymous access through pserver.\r\nNo passwords are sent in anonymous CVS access.\r\n\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;B&gt;High-capacity File Server&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Released versions of your project are stored on our\r\nextreme-capacity fileserver.

The official definition, as well\r\nas the rationale and history behind open source software, can be found\r\nat &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.opensource.org&quot;&gt;The Open Source Initiative&lt;/A&gt;\'s web site.\r\n&lt;P&gt;In the near future we will have an Open Source FAQ, with discussion\r\nabout the legalities of Open Source software, business justification,\r\nand market trends.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;what-beta&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;What is this &quot;public beta&quot;? When is your full release?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;SourceForge includes a lot of components, from the scripts that run behind\r\nthe scenes, to administrative pages for project leaders, to front-end material\r\nfor casual browsers. We have reached a stability point in most of the backend\r\ncode that we would like to start receiving input from developers on SourceForge.\r\n&lt;P&gt;SourceForge is now a very functional site/system, and in fact many developers\r\nare now working on projects from within the SourceForge framework. We now need\r\nyour help to mold SourceForge into a tool that will truly benefit\r\nOpen Source developers.\r\n&lt;P&gt;We will call ourselves a full release when we think the site is worthy of it.\r\nThe services are available now, however. The &quot;full release&quot; will be more of a\r\nsymbolic occasion than anything else.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;whodev-main&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;Who develops SourceForge?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;The &lt;A href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/staff.php&quot;&gt;SourceForge admin staff&lt;/A&gt;, Tony, Drew, Tim, and Uriah,\r\ndeveloped most of what you see on SourceForge now. We of course owe a lot of credit\r\nto the &lt;A href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/docs/site/software.php&quot;&gt;software&lt;/A&gt; that made our work a lot easier,\r\nand to the &lt;A href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/thanks.php&quot;&gt;people and organizations&lt;/A&gt; that donated time\r\nand hardware to make SourceForge possible. \r\n&lt;P&gt;SourceForge started out as a small idea that just refused to stop growing. \r\nMany people have been incredibly helpful along the way. We would like to thank\r\nthe entire open source community for the support that they are known for.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;whodev-why&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;Why did you create SourceForge?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;Strangely, a system this big wasn\'t our original intention. We really had no idea\r\nthat there would be such a reception for this kind of innovation in hosting\r\nopen source software.\r\n&lt;P&gt;As open source developers ourselves, we have run into the kinds of obstacles\r\nthat still plague many would-be developers. It was our intent to remove many\r\nof those obstacles and let developers focus on software development.\r\n(An odd concept, but easier to get used to than you\'d think.) \r\n&lt;P&gt;A suite of tools isn\'t enough, though. In the end, you need the hardware\r\npower for the whole setup, which might lead to your next question:\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;whodev-pays&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;Who pays for SourceForge?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A href=&quot;http://valinux.com&quot;&gt;VA Linux Systems&lt;/A&gt; has supported this project\r\nfrom the beginning. Some of us were employed by VA before the conception\r\nof SourceForge (although none had ever worked in the same department), others\r\nwere hired specifically for this project.\r\n&lt;P&gt;The &lt;A href=&quot;hardware.php&quot;&gt;hardware behind this site&lt;/A&gt; is truly\r\nimpressive, and has proven to us VA\'s dedication to this project and to Open Source\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;whodev-mot&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;What is the motivation to pay for something like this?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;Stop looking for ulterior motives or fantasies about world domination.\r\nThere are some good business reasons why a Linux company would\r\nbenefit from a site such as this.\r\n&lt;P&gt;VA Linux Systems thrives upon the success of Open Source software in\r\ngeneral. They sell Linux systems, installed with a myriad of Open Source\r\ntools and applications, to clients that require enterprise-ready\r\ncomponents and software. They also sell support for these systems.\r\nIf the selection and quality of Open Source\r\nsoftware improves, VA can offer its customers more competitive solutions.\r\n&lt;P&gt;On a more personal note, VA is not a behemoth with no sense\r\nof the community which made it grow. I joined VA because they would allow\r\nme to continue to spend significant amounts of my time in Open Source development.\r\nThey have never taken that freedom from me, and in fact have encouraged\r\nemployees to take part in community endeavors. This site is the real \r\nthing. -drew\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;whodev-catch&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;This seems like an awful lot of free stuff. What\'s the catch?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;There\'s no catch.\r\n&lt;P&gt;I\'m an Open Source developer. I work on a project to aid other Open Source developers.\r\nSo do many other developers. An Open Source friendly company pays for it, and we thank them a lot.\r\n&lt;P&gt;Do you always ask this many questions?\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;whodev-help&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;That\'s cool! I\'d really like to help. Can I?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;Of course.\r\n&lt;P&gt;We\'re working on a lot of ways that we can utilize the help of the\r\nrest of the community.\r\n&lt;P&gt;As soon as we can clean up some of this code and package it in some recognizable\r\nformat, we\'ll be releasing many of the SourceForge web-based tools as\r\nOpen Source projects in SourceForge. (That still confuses me, but\r\nsomehow the logic works.) This means that we can take on developers on \r\nthese projects, and as the tools improve, the new versions will automatically\r\nbe available to other SourceForge project developers.\r\n&lt;P&gt;There will also be a place for other users of SourceForge to help.\r\nWe expect to eventually have some sort of news system that will require maintenance,\r\nwe could definitely use help answering emails, and we could always\r\nuse help with site design. (Don\'t laugh. We\'re software developers, not artists.)\r\n&lt;P&gt;Everyone can help by answering the site surveys that we will\r\noccasionally post. Answers to these questions will directly influence\r\nthe direction of our development.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;whohost-main&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;Who can host with SourceForge?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;We\'re trying to keep it simple, and chose to rely on the work of a\r\nvery talented group, the &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.opensource.org&quot;&gt;Open Source Initiative&lt;/A&gt;.\r\nIf your software utilizes one of the OSI\'s \r\n&lt;A href=&quot;http://www.opensource.org/licenses/&quot;&gt;approved licenses&lt;/A&gt;, we\'d\r\nlove to offer you hosting at SourceForge. Software that falls under\r\nother licenses will require further scrutiny, but is not altogether ruled out.\r\nIn the end, we\'re looking to further Open Source software development,\r\nand will approve projects accordingly.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;whohost-web&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;What if I don\'t have software, but wanted you to host my web site?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;If you\'re site is oriented towards the Open Source community, we\'d\r\nprobably be happy to offer you hosting. Please be careful with this one, though.\r\nWe\'re not here to host personal homepages, or your Southpark picture\r\narchive (despite how much we all love Southpark). There are plenty of\r\nfree site hosting services for these sites. Our goal is the advancement\r\nof Open Source, and if your web site does that, we\'d love to have you.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;whohost-rest&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;Are there any restrictions on the types of software I can host here?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;For legal reasons, we can\'t host strong-encryption products with code\r\nthat originated outside of the US. We\'re working on a system to allow the hosting\r\nUS-originated strong-encryption, with restricted access to downloads.\r\n&lt;P&gt;We are also not set up with the right age-checking mechanisms to host\r\nmaterial/software of a pornographic nature. (As nice as a local connection\r\nto your porn archive might be to us, we just can\'t do it.) There is a more complete definition\r\nof these restrictions in the terms of service agreement, presented \r\nduring project registration.\r\n&lt;P&gt;Cut us some slack on this one. We\'re trying to keep ourselves and the\r\ncompany that provided all of this hardware and bandwidth out of trouble.\r\nWe\'re not here to start a political discussion.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;whohost-com&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;Can I host commercial software on SourceForge?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;Maybe.\r\n&lt;P&gt;If your commercially developed software is Open Source, then yes.\r\n&lt;P&gt;If your commercially developed software is not yet Open Source, but will be later, then probably yes.\r\n&lt;P&gt;If your commercially developed software is not Open Source, but may help\r\nto advance other Open Source software, then maybe.\r\n&lt;P&gt;If you just like our tools so much that you want to use them, then\r\ngo ahead. We\'ll be releasing many of them as Open Source soon. If this\r\n\r\nprospect overwhelms you, then contact VA Linux Professional\r\nServices, they\'ll be glad to help you. (Shameless plug for\r\nour sponsors.)\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;whohost-owns&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;Who owns the source code on SourceForge?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;The individual authors hold the copyright on their own software. Because\r\nof the nature of Open Source licenses, we are allowed to give people access\r\nto that software; however, all license disputes and issues are the responsibilities\r\nof the individual authors.\r\n&lt;P&gt;There is often a misconception that Open Source software does not actually\r\nhave a license holder, because of its free nature. This is not the case, however,\r\nand software hosted on SourceForge is responsible for its own licensing.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;whohost-stop&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;What if I host with SourceForge, then decide to stop?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;We would of course like to solve any problems you were having before it came\r\nto this, but in the end, you are free to leave at anytime. After all, we\'re not\r\nthe copyright holders.\r\n&lt;P&gt;Because your software was/is Open Source, however, we will probably still\r\nhave the right to continue to make existing versions of your software available\r\nto the public. If we didn\'t, someone else probably would anyway.\r\n&lt;P&gt;We\'re happy people here. Can\'t we all just Open Source and be happy together?\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;whyhost-main&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;Why should I host my software with SourceForge?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;...mumble...free...mumble...gift horse....\r\n&lt;P&gt;But seriously, we\'re not trying to force anything on anybody here. We would\r\nlove people to host with SourceForge because we are a superior hosting service.\r\nIn the spirit of Open Source, we want any popularity we gain to be merit-based.\r\n&lt;P&gt;As we grow, we will also be able to provide you with traffic to your project.\r\nThere is a lot of benefit to giving end-users a window into your development\r\nenvironment. There will be more peer review of your source, and potential developers\r\nwill be wandering by.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;whyhost-secure&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;Is SourceForge secure?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;Yes, we have taken extreme caution in the methods we use for SourceForge\r\nservices. No system is uncrackable, but we continuously monitor the software\r\nwe use for bugs and security holes, and audit our own software regularly.\r\n&lt;P&gt;Encryption is available and enforced on all parts of the SourceForge site\r\nexcept mailing lists. (These passwords should be different than your site\r\npasswords. We are in the process of modifying GNU Mailman to use our own \r\nsecure authentication system.)\r\n&lt;P&gt;We give SSH accounts rather than telnet, SCP rather than ftp, and\r\nCVS/SSH instead of pserver. Site logins are via SSL and site passwords\r\nare never stored nor communicated in plaintext. Because it is possible\r\nto change your site password by confirming your email address (via\r\na partial MD5 hash sent to your registered address), we recommend that\r\nyou also keep your own mail account secure.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;whyhost-backup&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;What is your backup strategy?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;We perform a full backup of all site and project data daily, and rotate\r\nbackups off-site weekly through a large company that specializes in\r\nstoring backup tapes. \r\nWe also have access to a fireproof safe for storage of\r\ndaily tapes.\r\n&lt;P&gt;The exception to this rotation is the mega-file-server, which cannot be fully\r\nbacked up (when full) by less than 34 25GB AIT tapes (our medium of\r\nchoice). It gets a full backup once per month and incrementals otherwise. \r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;whyhost-all&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;Do I have to use all of your services? \r\nCan I just use mailing lists, or bug tracking?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;You can use whatever you want. If you don\'t need all of the services now,\r\ndon\'t use them. They are there when you need them.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;whyhost-root&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;Won\'t I lose a lot of control if I don\'t have root access?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;Yes and no.\r\n&lt;P&gt;The tradeoff is the security and stability of a professionally managed server.\r\n&lt;P&gt;Once initial setup is through, there really isn\'t much need for root\r\naccess except for security and maintenance upgrades, which we are taking\r\ncare of. We would like to implement all other functions for which you would\r\nnormally require root access via a web interface.\r\n&lt;P&gt;Obviously we can\'t give root access to everyone, or your own security\r\nis at the disposal of any other project admin. We\'re trying to find a happy\r\nmedium. In general we\'ll try to give as much access as we can without damaging\r\nthe security of other projects within SourceForge.\r\n&lt;P&gt;In the end, we\'re here to serve you. VA Linux Systems now pays our salary to\r\noffer you these services. We\'re a pretty responsive bunch. We\'d like to work\r\nthrough any issues you have, just let us know what we need to do. We hope\r\nthat you\'ll find our web administration tools powerful and easy to use. We\'re \r\nconstantly continuing to develop and improve these tools.\r\nIf there is some feature we can add that you think we\'ve forgotten, \r\nplease let us know.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;whyhost-cvs&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;I already have a cvs tree. Can you import it?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;Yes. Register a new project normally and let us know you need to import a\r\nCVS tree. We\'ll need a tar/gzip of your entire document root, including CVSROOT\r\ndirectory. This will preserve your revision history.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;whyhost-files&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;I have a lot of file releases already. \r\nCan I make them available on the main file server?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;Yes, when releasing new files via the project admin interface, there\r\nis an option to set the release date of each file. You may back-populate\r\nyour release history in this manner. That way all previous revisions of your\r\nsoftware are available on the main file server.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;big-main&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;So how big is all this, really?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;We are all of course biased, but it is this writer\'s opinion that this is one\r\nof the best opportunities for Open Source developers in history.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;big-fad&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;Isn\'t Open Source a fad? Can it really work?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;Ack! \r\n&lt;P&gt;This site\'s developers and the company behind it believe deeply in the concepts\r\nof Open Source software.\r\n&lt;P&gt;Open Source is not a fad. Open Source can and does work. This site is proof of\r\nthat. We would not have been able to offer many of our functions without modifications\r\nto many programs we use. Their open source let us make these modifications (which\r\nwere sent back to the original authors for inclusion in the next versions of their\r\nsoftware).\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;RANT&gt;I can\'t believe that after BIND, Apache, Samba, PERL, Linux, and the\r\nGNU toolset, you can still ask that question.&lt;/RANT&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;big-cap&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;How much capacity does SourceForge have right now?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;A quick look at our &lt;A href=&quot;hardware.php&quot;&gt;hardware list&lt;/A&gt; will partially\r\nanswer that question.\r\n&lt;P&gt;We\'ve performed many real-world benchmarks of the various parts of our systems.\r\nWe are capable of handling many projects now, and will scale our systems\r\nto meet demand. Nobody likes a slow server, especially us.\r\n&lt;P&gt;If you want some quick stats on our current systems, here you go:\r\n&lt;UL&gt;\r\n&lt;LI&gt;At 100% usage, our main web servers can handle approximately 8.6 million PHP pageviews\r\ndaily. (Including all of the site authentication necessary for each view.)\r\n&lt;LI&gt;The project web server can handle about 12 million pageviews daily with simple PHP\r\npages, and some unknown (think large numbers) millions of static pages.\r\n&lt;LI&gt;We can\'t properly benchmark our main file server, because we keep saturating its\r\ncurrent 100Mbit connection. We\'ve managed to get 93.8Mbit with 5000 concurrent HTTP\r\nconnections with it though (using only one of its four processors). If we start\r\napproaching our facility bandwidth (a couple of DS-3\'s and a T-1 right now), then we\'ll start\r\nlooking at gigabit and more digital drops. (Don\'t tell the CFO.)\r\n&lt;LI&gt;The 1.3 terabytes of storage in the room gets very loud.\r\n&lt;LI&gt;We blew many circuit-breakers when we were building this thing. Dedicated\r\n220V/30A power circuits solved this problem.\r\n&lt;LI&gt;Our UPS weighs about as much as our entire team.\r\n&lt;LI&gt;VA systems rock. (Another shameless sponsor plug)\r\n&lt;/UL&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;big-scale&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;Wow. That\'s a lot. Can it scale?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;Yes, and don\'t threaten us or we\'ll do it.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;big-mirror&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;Are you going to mirror SourceForge? (and can I pay for it?)&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;We will probably be mirroring the main file server sometime in the near\r\nfuture. The real problem is the databases behind the main website and synchronization\r\nof all the other servers in real-time.\r\n&lt;P&gt;For now, we\'re content to have good backups, and spare hardware to put\r\nin place if something should fail. \r\n&lt;P&gt;We do take reliability seriously, and a non-west-coast mirror does seem like\r\na good idea. In lieu of a realtime mirror, we\'re considering setting up a \r\nfailover mirror that would lag a few minutes behind the live site.\r\nWe\'re pursuing our options here and will keep you posted.\r\n&lt;P&gt;As for the second question... VA\'s CFO says, yes, you may pay for it.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;big-ready&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;I thought Linux wasn\'t ready for the \r\nenterprise. What was your setup experience like?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;We\'re working on a paper detailing our experience setting up this system.\r\nWe expect to publish it soon.\r\n&lt;P&gt;For those of you that can\'t wait, it can be summarized, &quot;Yay Open Source.&quot;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;big-wait&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;What improvements in Linux/Open Source software are you still waiting for? &lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;We\'re especially anxious to see shared disk arrays over fibre channel,\r\na journalled file system (although we\'re looking at promising ones now),\r\n32-bit UIDs (should be fixed with the new file system),\r\nbetter scheduling (apparent in the development Linux kernels),\r\nand support for my Philips PC Camera.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;big-future&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;What is the future of SourceForge?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;It is looking good, my friend.\r\n&lt;P&gt;VA is committed, we\'re committed, and we\'ve already got ideas that will\r\ncontinue to drive us for months.\r\n&lt;P&gt;The rest is up to you. Help us to help you, and we can all help to advance\r\nOpen Source to new heights.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;whowrote&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;Who wrote this FAQ?

See\r\n   http://www.php.net/ and remember that you must re-compile php3 with\r\n   MySQL support.\r\n\r\n3) Activate php3.\r\n\r\n   In order to activate php3 the following lines must be found in the\r\n   httpd.conf file:\r\n\r\n   LoadModule php3_module        modules/libphp3.so\r\n   AddModule mod_php3.c\r\n\r\n4) Enable index.php as a directory index in srm.conf. \r\n\r\n   DirectoryIndex index.html index.shtml index.cgi index.php\r\n\r\n5) Add .php extension to srm.conf.\r\n\r\n   AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .php3 .php .phtml \r\n   AddType application/x-httpd-php3-source .phps \r\n\r\n6) Try loading http://localhost/phpinfo.php again.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nConfiguring php3 and Apache for SourceForge\r\n\r\n1) Change the DocumentRoot\r\n\r\n   Since some scripts assume that the document root starts at the\r\n   www directory, just say that the document root is this directory.\r\n\r\n   In srm.conf\r\n\r\n   DocumentRoot /home/loic/local/ports/SourceForge/www\r\n\r\n   In access.conf substitute/clone the &lt;Directory&gt; block for the\r\n   new document root.\r\n\r\n2) Type the URL http://localhost/ in your navigator.\r\n\r\n   You should see an error message like this:\r\n\r\n   Fatal error: Failed opening required \'pre.php\' in /home/httpd/html/sf/index.php on line 9\r\n   meaning that Apache is properly configured as far as php is concerned.\r\n\r\n3) Specify the include path.\r\n\r\n   You must tell php where the include files are. Add the full path to\r\n   ../SourceForge/www/include to the include_path variable of the\r\n   php.ini file. Something like\r\n\r\n   include_path = /home/php:/home/loic/local/ports/SourceForge/www/include\r\n\r\n   Alternatively you can add the following lines in httpd.conf:\r\n\r\n   &lt;Directory /&gt; \r\n   php3_include_path /usr/local/htdocs/alexandria/www/include:. \r\n   &lt;/Directory&gt;\r\n\r\n4) Include magic in php.ini.\r\n\r\n   magic_quotes_gpc = On ; magic quotes for incoming GET/POST/Cookie data \r\n   magic_quotes_runtime = Off ; magic quotes for runtime-generated data, e.g. data from SQL, \r\n   track_vars = On ; enable $HTTP_GET_VARS[], $HTTP_POST_VARS[] and $HTTP_COOKIE_VARS[] arrays \r\n\r\n5) Restart httpd\r\n\r\n6) Type the URL http://localhost/ in your navigator. Two things\r\n    may happen at that point:\r\n\r\n    a) You\'re redirected to http://sourceforge.net/ since that\'s what the library does\r\n       when you\'re not using localhost in the URL.\r\n\r\n    b) You see an error message like this:\r\n\r\n       Fatal error: Failed opening required \'/etc/local.inc\' in database.php on line 11\r\n\r\n    In either cases it means that the pre.php file was found and that the include\r\n    path is correct. \r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nConfiguring SourceForge\r\n\r\n1) Copy the SourceForge/etc/local.inc sample to /etc/local.inc. Edit\r\n   it to fit your system parameters. Variables should have self explanatory\r\n   names or comments to make it clearer.\r\n\r\n2) Look at the home page http://localhost/\r\n   It should display well.\r\n\r\n3) Create a user named admin\r\n\r\n   This user will automatically be assigned server wide administration permissions.\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n',

The protocol used is ssh protocol version 1.\r\nYou must not try to use ssh protocol version 2. If you have both ssh1 and ssh2 installed\r\non your machine, the ssh1 commands are all suffixed with a 1. For instance use ssh1 instead\r\nof ssh or ssh-keygen1 instead of ssh-keygen.\r\n&lt;P&gt;\r\nCVS will use SSH for authentification if you set the environment variable CVS_RSH to ssh.\r\nCVS_RSH=ssh or CVS_RSH=ssh1.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;ssh-firewall&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;Why cvs hangs forever?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;If you\'re behind a firewall you may need to instruct ssh not to use a privileged port.\r\nInsert the \r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;\r\nUsePrivilegedPort no\r\n&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nline in your ~/.ssh/config file. This is equivalent to\r\nspecifying the -P option on the command line. You need to do that since you can\'t simply\r\nset CVS_RSH=\'ssh -P\'.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;ssh-key&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;Am I forced to enter my password for every cvs command?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;No, you can upload a shared key that will allow SSH sessions to be established without\r\nthe need to enter you password every time. Go to your &lt;b&gt;Account Maintainance page&lt;/b&gt;, click on\r\nthe &lt;b&gt;Edit Keys&lt;/b&gt; link and follow the instructions.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;ssh-pass&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;I updated my CVS/SSH shared key but\r\nI\'m still asked for a passphrase?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;A passphrase is not a password. When you used ssh-keygen (or\r\nssh-keygen1) to produce your shared key, you were asked for a\r\npassphrase. There are two possibilities to avoid cvs passphrase\r\nprompts: you can use ssh-agent tool or you can generate key pair\r\nwithout passphrase.\r\n&lt;P&gt;To use ssh-agent edit your .xsession (or .xstart) script and change\r\nline where window manager is started into:\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;   ssh-agent $WM\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;where $WM is your window manager. Logout-login to activate the\r\nssh-agent.  Use ssh-add to add your key to the ssh-agent (you must\r\nenter the passphrase). As long as the ssh-agent runs you will not be\r\nprompted for the passphrase again. For more details see the man pages\r\nof ssh-agent and ssh-add.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;To generate unprotected key pair just type return at the ssh-keygen\r\npassphrase prompt. The drawback of the unprotected key pair is that\r\neverybody who has your private key will have access to the cvs\r\nrepository.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;A name=&quot;ssh-shell&quot;&gt; &lt;/A&gt;&lt;B&gt;CVS does not work on shell.sourceforge.net?&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;\r\nWhen you\'re logged on shell.sourceforge.net using ssh1, you should use the\r\n&lt;b&gt;cvs1&lt;/b&gt; hostname instead of the full host name. For instance:\r\n&lt;P&gt;\r\n&lt;UL&gt;\r\n&lt;LI&gt; &lt;b&gt;Not good:&lt;/b&gt; cvs -dprecision@cvs.phpsysinfo.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phpsysinfo -z3 co phpsysinfo\r\n&lt;LI&gt; &lt;b&gt;Good:&lt;/b&gt; cvs -dprecision@cvs1:/cvsroot/phpsysinfo -z3 co phpsysinfo\r\n&lt;/UL&gt;\r\nThis has to do with the fact that both the shell\r\nservers and the cvs servers are firewalled behind the same firewall. Since you\'re inside\r\nthe firewall when you\'re logged on shell.sourceforge.net, the rules do not apply in the same\r\nway.',

CVS does\r\na reasonable job of allowing source changes to be controlled and\r\nmanaged, but does not provide tools to make it easier to work with a\r\nchanging code base.  The hardest part of working on a dynamic project\r\nwith many changing modules is knowing when changes occur, and what\r\nthose changes are.\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nSoftware developers often are heavy email users, spending huge amounts\r\nof time working with their email software.  Open source developers are\r\namong the most serious email addicts out there, sorting through\r\nhundreds of emails a day, since this is often the only way to stay in\r\ntouch with users and fellow developers.\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;em&gt;Clearly, we need more email.&lt;/em&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Set up a mailing list&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nIf you haven\'t already created a mailing list to handle messages sent\r\nby CVS, follow these instructions to do so.\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nTo get started, surf to your project\'s &quot;Project Page.&quot;  If the &quot;Public\r\nAreas&quot; section of the page doesn\'t list &quot;Mailing Lists,&quot; click over to\r\nthe &lt;b&gt;Project Admin&lt;/b&gt; page, the to the &lt;b&gt;Edit Public Info&lt;/b&gt;\r\npage.

You want\r\nyour users to be able to subscribe so they\'ll know when you\'ve fixed\r\nthe bug they reported, because they want to try out the changes as\r\nsoon as they\'re in.\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nOk, so you really only had to decide one thing -- that\'s even better.\r\nNow, click the &quot;Add This List&quot; button, and wait for your list to be\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Set up syncmail&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;syncmail&lt;/b&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.python.org/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;\r\nscript written by Barry Warsaw to send mail to the\r\n&lt;tt&gt;python-checkins&lt;/tt&gt; list long ago, before the Python development\r\ntree moved to SourceForge.  It\'s undergone a bit of evolution, but\r\nessentially does one thing: send email based on CVS activity.  It\r\ntakes a little bit of information from CVS and generates messages that\r\ninclude useful information, such as the actual changes that happened\r\nto the modified files.  It shoves all this into email that gets sent\r\nto an email address passed on the command line.  For projects with\r\nenough developers that &lt;b&gt;syncmail&lt;/b&gt; becomes interesting, this will\r\ntypically be a mailing list.\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nFor your project, this will be\r\n&lt;tt&gt;yourproject-checkins@lists.sourceforge.net&lt;/tt&gt; or\r\n&lt;tt&gt;yourproject-cvs@lists.sourceforget.net&lt;/tt&gt;, depending on the name\r\nyou chose in the first part of these instructions.\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nTo install &lt;b&gt;syncmail&lt;/b&gt;, you need a working copy of the &lt;font\r\n\r\nface=&quot;sans serif&quot;&gt;CVSROOT&lt;/font&gt; directory from your CVS repository.\r\nCheck it out just like you did for your project modules, but with the\r\nmodule name &quot;CVSROOT&quot;.\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nNow, get the latest version of &lt;b&gt;syncmail&lt;/b&gt;.  The canonical copy is\r\nin the repository for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.list.org/&quot;&gt;GNU\r\nMailman&lt;/a&gt; mailing list manager (the one you\'re using for the\r\ncheckins list you set up earlier).  Get it from SourceForge:\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;a\r\n\r\nhref=&quot;http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/CVSROOT/syncmail?cvsroot=mailman&quot;\r\n&gt;http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/CVSROOT/syncmail?cvsroot=mailman&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nSave the most recent revision to your working copy of your project\'s\r\n&lt;font face=&quot;sans serif&quot;&gt;CVSROOT&lt;/font&gt; directory.  Use &lt;b&gt;chmod +x&lt;/b&gt;\r\nto set the executable bit for all users, and then add the file to your\r\nproject: &lt;b&gt;cvs add syncmail&lt;/b&gt;; &lt;b&gt;cvs commit syncmail&lt;/b&gt;.  You\r\nprobably want to mention in your comment message where the file came\r\nfrom and the revision number you picked up.\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nSend a support request to SourceForge asking the admin to check out a\r\nworking copy of &lt;b&gt;syncmail&lt;/b&gt; into your &lt;font face=&quot;sans\r\nserif&quot;&gt;CVSROOT&lt;/font&gt; directory and verify that it gets the proper\r\nexecutable permissions.  The admin only needs to execute &lt;b&gt;cd\r\n/cvsroot/yourproject/CVSROOT&lt;/b&gt;; &lt;b&gt;co syncmail&lt;/b&gt; to get the\r\ndesired behavior.  Copy those commands into your support request to\r\nmake it easy on the admin; they\'re busy people!  Be sure to change\r\n&quot;yourproject&quot; to the real Unix name for your project.\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Configure CVS to use syncmail&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nNow that you\'ve spent the better part of a day (or night) reading\r\nthese instructions, and a few minutes following them, you have just a\r\ntiny bit more to do to get CVS to put &lt;b&gt;syncmail&lt;/b&gt; to work.\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n&lt;em&gt;After&lt;/em&gt; some stressed out, overworked SoruceForge administrator\r\nhas handled your request to checkout a working copy of &lt;b&gt;syncmail&lt;/b&gt;\r\ninto the repository, you need to modify your &lt;font face=&quot;sans\r\nserif&quot;&gt;CVSROOT/loginfo&lt;/font&gt; file to tell CVS to invoke\r\n&lt;b&gt;syncmail&lt;/b&gt; for all the interesting events CVS is willing to tell\r\nus about.\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nIf you have not modified the &lt;font face=&quot;sans serif&quot;\r\n&gt;CVSROOT/loginfo&lt;/font&gt; file from the stock file provided by\r\nSourceForge (which is very useful, as the comments include\r\ndocumentation), what you need to do is very simple: just add stuff to\r\nthe end.  Here\'s some example stuff to get you started:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nCVSROOT $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/syncmail %{sVv} you@someplace.else\r\n\r\nDEFAULT $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/syncmail %{sVv} myproject-checkins@lists.sourceforge.net\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThis will cause email to be sent to two different places, with which\r\ndepending on what files in the repository are affected.  For\r\nadministrative files in the &lt;font face=&quot;sans serif&quot;&gt;CVSROOT&lt;/font&gt;\r\ndirectory, email will be sent to &lt;tt&gt;you@someplace.else&lt;/tt&gt;; you\r\nshould probably list all your project administrators here.  For all\r\nother files, email will be sent to your mailing list (remember to\r\nchange the list name to match &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; mailing list!).\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nIf you have several sub-products for which you want different checkin\r\nlists, you can change the &quot;DEFAULT&quot; label to match the subtree that\r\nyou want to go to each list, with a separate line for each distinct\r\nprefix.  For example, if your project includes the products &quot;one&quot; and\r\n&quot;two&quot;, you could use the following:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nCVSROOT $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/syncmail %{sVv} you@someplace.else\r\n\r\none/ $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/syncmail %{sVv} myproject-one-cvs@lists.sourceforge.net\r\ntwo/ $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/syncmail %{sVv} myproject-two-cvs@lists.sourceforge.net\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nYou can still have a &quot;DEFAULT&quot; line that gets used for any additional\r\nsubprojects.\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nIf you do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have a stock &lt;font face=&quot;sans serif&quot;\r\n&gt;CVSROOT/loginfo&lt;/font&gt; file, then you can probably figure out what\r\nyou need to do to combine the information above with your existing\r\nchanges.  You might not have even needed any of these instructions!\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nCheck in your changes to &lt;font face=&quot;sans serif&quot;&gt;CVSROOT/loginfo&lt;/font&gt;\r\nand check in some other change in your working directories to test your\r\nnew configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Read email!&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nNow for the real test.  If you have started a successful Open Source\r\nproject, you will not be able to catch up with your email.  If you can\r\nkeep up with it and still have time to hack, you need to make your\r\nproject more attractive to others, so you can get more developers\r\nchecking in more changes.  Then you\'ll always have more email than you\r\nknow what to do with!',

This is great since UNIX provides a full set of tools for\r\ncommunicating with SourceForge, usually without having to install anything\r\nbeyond your normal system.

You\'ll need some tools of your own to get going with SourceForge\r\nas well.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;CVS&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;CVS is the version control system used on SourceForge. This is where you\'ll\r\nstore your source code to all your revisions of your project. You use a CVS\r\nclient on your end to communicate with the CVS server (the repository) on the\r\nSourceForge end. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;CVS keeps a record of every change made to the source code, along with\r\ncomments about that change. At any time you can see any previous version of any\r\nfile in the repository. It allows multiple people to work on the same files at\r\nthe same time, merging the changes as they are &quot;committed&quot;, and\r\nalarming the user if two changes conflict making sure the difference is resolved\r\nby a human being before allowing the new version of that file to be placed into\r\nthe repository.\r\n&lt;p&gt;This may take some getting used to however. Basically the development cycle\r\ngoes like this:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n  &lt;li&gt;Code is imported into the repository&lt;/li&gt;\r\n  &lt;li&gt;Everyone working on the project &quot;checks out&quot; a working copy of\r\n    the source tree (or a portion thereof) to their local drives&lt;/li&gt;\r\n  &lt;li&gt;Each person works in the comfort of their own computer generated reality,\r\n    and when they have a new feature working, they &quot;update&quot; their\r\n    local copy to be as much in sync with the current version as possible, and\r\n    then they &quot;commit&quot; the files that have changed, back into the\r\n    repository.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Any problems CVS has with commiting the files will be mentioned, and you must\r\nthen go through the problem files and resolve the differences manually. In the\r\nfiles, the changed section is highlighted with &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and both\r\nversions are shown. Simply delete the old version (or edit to make it work how\r\nits supposed to), and re-commit the file. Once CVS has no problem, return to\r\nstep 2, and get back to work !&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The manual for CVS can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fsf.org/manual/cvs-1.9/cvs.html&quot;&gt;http://www.fsf.org/manual/cvs-1.9/cvs.html&lt;/a&gt;.\r\nI suggest you take some time to read through it when you get a chance. It will\r\nhelp later.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;SSH&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;SSH is a secure mechanism for connecting to SourceForge\'s servers. You can\r\nfind a copy of SSH for Windows &lt;a href=&quot;ftp://ftp.cs.hut.fi/pub/ssh/contrib/ssh-1.2.14-win32bin.zip&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\r\nIt\'s just like telnet but provides a secure connection to SourceForge.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;SCP&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;SCP is like a secure FTP client and allows you to put files onto SourceForges\r\nsystem. SCP is usually bundled with SSH so the link\r\nabove will get you both programs.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Once you have all the files you\'re ready to setup your environment to connect\r\nto SourceForge. There\'s only a few things that need to be done, but it\'s\r\nimportant you do them or else your connection will probably not work.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;SSH&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;1. You\'ll need to unpack the SSH distribution files somewhere in your path.\r\nEither unzip them to a directory already in your path or create a new path and\r\nadd it to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. For example, if you put them in C:\\BIN\r\nthen add this to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file: &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;pre&gt;SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\\BIN&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;2. You\'ll need a &quot;home&quot; directory where SSH will store settings for\r\nyou. This can be anywhere but set it up by adding an environmental variable to\r\nyour AUTOEXEC.BAT file like this:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;pre&gt;SET HOME=D:\\HOME &lt;/pre&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;(or wherever you want your home directory to be)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;3. You need to create an \\ETC directory on the same drive you set your HOME\r\ndirectory to. In the example above, create a directory on drive D: called ETC:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;pre&gt;D:\r\nMD \\ETC&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;4. Create a text file in this new directory called PASSWD. The file should\r\nhave one line in it that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;pre&gt;bsimser:x:1:10:Simser, Bil:d:/home:c:/windows/command.com&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Each entry is separated by a colon (&quot;:&quot;). The first entry is your\r\nSourceForge username. Make sure it\'s all in lower case. Don\'t worry about the\r\nnext 4 entries. The 6th entry is the path to your HOME directory you setup in\r\nstep 2. This can include a drive letter but remember to use the &quot;/&quot;\r\ncharacter instead of the normal DOS &quot;\\&quot;. The next entry points to your\r\ncommand interpreter (command.com on Windows 95/98, cmd.exe on Windows NT). This\r\nisn\'t used but you need an entry here.\r\n&lt;p&gt;5. Restart your system so your environmental variables and path can be\r\nupdated.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n  &lt;p&gt;6. You\'re ready to test your connection to SourceForge. From a DOS prompt\r\n  enter the following command:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n  &lt;pre&gt;ssh -l bsimser projectname.sourceforge.net&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n  &lt;p&gt;Replace bsimser with your SourceForge username. If this is your first time\r\n  connecting you\'ll see a message saying SSH is adding the host to your known\r\n  hosts. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n  &lt;p&gt;7. Enter your password at the prompt. Congratulations! You should now be\r\n  logged into SourceForge through SSH.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n  &lt;p&gt;SSH will create a new directory the first time you log into SourceForge in\r\n  your HOME directory called &quot;.SSH&quot;. In this directory are two files.\r\n  &quot;random_seed&quot; is just a binary file so don\'t worry about it (let me\r\n  know if you know what it\'s used for). Each time you log into a project on\r\n  SourceForge through SSH, an entry will be added to a binary file called &quot;known_hosts&quot;\r\n  (remember the message when you logged in?). Again, I\'m not sure what this file\r\n  is used for.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;CVS &lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;CVS comes in two flavours, command line version and Windows GUI. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Command Line&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;1. Download\r\nthe command line version of CVS for Windows &lt;a href=&quot;http://download.cyclic.com/pub/cvs-1.10/windows/cvs-1.10-win.zip&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;2. Unpack the command line version (CVS.EXE) to a pathed directory of your\r\nchoosing. You can put it in the same directory as SSH for convenience.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;3. Add the following environmental variables to your AUTOEXEC.BAT:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;pre&gt;SET CVSROOT=username@cvs.projectname.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/projectname\r\nSET USERNAME=username\r\nSET HOMEDRIVE=d:\r\nSET HOME=\\home\r\nSET HOMEPATH=\\home\r\nSET CVS_RSH=ssh&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n  &lt;p&gt;Change the context to your own SourceForge username and the HOME and\r\n  HOMEPATH variables to the ones you used in the SSH setup. Change projectname\r\n  to the short name for your SourceForge project.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n  &lt;p&gt;4. You can now import your local source code to CVS on SourceForge. Switch\r\n  to the root directory of your project on your local hard drive like so:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n  &lt;pre&gt;CD \\SRC\\PROJECTNAME\r\ncvs -dusername@cvs.projectname.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/projectname import directoryname vendor start&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n  &lt;p&gt;NOTE: The following has also been reported to work (let me know if it\r\n  does):&lt;/p&gt;\r\n  &lt;pre&gt;cvs -d:ext:username@cvs.projectname.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/projectname import directoryname vendor start&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n  &lt;p&gt;Substitute your username and projectname as before. Directoryname is the\r\n  name of the new directory that will be created in your CVS repository -- you\'ll\r\n  probably want to use your project name for this as well.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n  &lt;p&gt;5. To checkout a copy of the latest source use this command:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n  &lt;pre&gt;cvs -dusername@cvs.projectname.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/projectname co projectname&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n  After the initial checkout, you can change into this directory and execute cvs\r\n  commands without the -d tag. For example:\r\n  &lt;pre&gt;cvs update\r\ncvs commit -m &quot;comments for this commit&quot;\r\ncvs add myfile.c&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Windows GUI&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;1. Download the Windows GUI client from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wincvs.org&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;2. Unzip the file into a temporary directory and run SETUP.EXE.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;3. Start the WinCvs client.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;4. Restart your system.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;4. Under Admin | Preferences enter the CVSROOT for your project:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;pre&gt;username@cvs.projectname.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/projectname&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;5. Under Admin | Login login to CVS. It will prompt you for your SourceForge password.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;6. You can now use the menu commands to check in/out source code from the\r\nGUI.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Website&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So now that you have your source code imported and working how about setting\r\nup your projects website!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;1. Create your website locally using whatever HTML editor you want.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;2. Upload the file(s) with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;pre&gt;scp filename.htm username@shell.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/projectname/htdocs&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;That\'s it! If you have a lot of files you might want to use gzip to compress\r\nthem into one file and upload them instead of doing it file by file. Follow\r\nthese instructions for this technique:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\r\n  &lt;p&gt;1. You\'ll need to ZIP your files up with something like WinZip. Don\'t\r\n  worry, gunzip on the Unix side can handle ZIP files (or at least it should).\r\n  You can find WinZip &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.winzip.com&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Create your ZIP\r\n  file of all your HTML, GIF, etc. files.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;2. Upload the ZIP file to SourceForge:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;pre&gt;scp filename.zip username@shell.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/projectname/htdocs&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;3. Login to SourceForge with the SSH command:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;pre&gt;ssh -l username projectname.sourceforge.net&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You will now be in your home directory. From here all group files are stored\r\nin /home/groups/projectname. Change to this directory. All your web pages are\r\nstored in the htdocs directory.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;4. Unzip the file on SourceForge:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;pre&gt;gunzip -d filename.zip&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n  &lt;p&gt;5. Make sure your files were unzipped successfully with the command:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n  &lt;pre&gt;ls -l&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n  &lt;p&gt;6. Remove the ZIP file from SourceForge:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n  &lt;pre&gt;rm filename.zip&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;That\'s it! You now can import your source code, work with CVS and upload your\r\nwebsite. That should be enough to keep you going on SourceForge.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n  &lt;li&gt;Joel Utting\'s &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/docs/site/user/newproject-howto.php&quot;&gt;SourceForge New Project HOWTO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n  &lt;li&gt;Jay Andrew Key\'s &lt;a href=&quot;http://akrip.sourceforge.net/cvs-ssh-win32-howto.txt&quot;&gt;win32 on SourceForge HOWTO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n',

        '&lt;p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;\r\nTitle: cvs/ssh/win32 on SourceForge HowTo\r\nVersion: 0.3\r\nDate: 03-Jan-2000\r\nAuthor: Jay A. Key, scsiprog@geocities.com\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Introduction\r\nThis document intends to provide a quick and dirty guide to using SSH and\r\nCVS on SourceForge in a Win32 environment.  These steps worked for me, and\r\nit is my hope that they will provide a starting point for others as well.\r\nIt took a fair amount of trial and error to find two distributions of SSH\r\nand CVS that would work together to access the CVS repository on SourceForge.\r\nWith the setup described below, I am able to access the repository both\r\nthrough a permanent connection through a firewall and via a dialup connection.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Files\r\nThese are the versions of cvs and ssh that I have made to work together:\r\n  ssh:  ftp://ftp.cs.hut.fi/pub/ssh/contrib/ssh-1.2.14-win32bin.zip\r\n  cvs:  http://download.cyclic.com/pub/cvs-1.10/windows/cvs-1.10-win.zip\r\nAdditionally, you may want to download a different SSH archive to be able\r\nto generate an SSH keypair (Optional).  One such archive can be found at\r\n  http://dome.weeg.uiowa.edu/sos/ssh-without-cygwin.html \r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Setup\r\n  Setup for SSH\r\n  1. Create directories for the SSH executables and config files\r\n       md c:\\usr\\local\\bin\r\n       md c:\\etc\r\n  2. If you don\'t have a \'home\' directory for yourself, create it now.  For\r\n     example, my home directory is c:\\users\\ak.  In the home directory, \r\n     create a .ssh directory -- this is where your ssh keys will be stored.\r\n       md c:\\users\r\n       md c:\\users\\ak\r\n       md c:\\users\\ak\\.ssh\r\n  3. Unpack the ssh-1.2.14-win32bin.zip archive into c:\\usr\\local\\bin\r\n  4. Add c:\\usr\\local\\bin to your path.  You may wish to add this to your\r\n     autoexec.bat:\r\n       set path=%path%;c:\\usr\\local\\bin\r\n  5. Using your favorite text editor, create a PASSWD file in c:\\etc.  The\r\n     format of a line the file is:\r\n       keyja:x:1:10:Key, Jay A.:/users/ak/:/windows/command.com\r\n     The important items are #1, #6.  #1 is the login name on the local\r\n     machine.  #6 is your home directory.  #7 is the command shell on your\r\n     system (command.com on Win95 and cmd.exe on NT) -- but since it is not\r\n     a *NIX shell, it\'s probably useless to put it in there :-).\r\n  6. Set your HOME environment variable (again, remember to add it to\r\n     autoexec.bat as well) to the same directory you entered as item #6 in\r\n     the /etc/passwd file:\r\n       set HOME=c:\\users\\ak\r\n  7. Optional: Generate an ssh keypair.  Unfortunately, the ssh-keygen in \r\n     the ssh-1.2.14-win32bin.zip archive doesn\'t appear to work.  You can \r\n     fortunately use the ssh-keygen executable from a different SSH archive.\r\n     This step is not strictly necessary, since you\'ll have to type in\r\n     either your password or your passphrase every time you use it.\r\n       ssh-keygen\r\n     After running this command, verify that identity and identity.pub are\r\n     present in your .ssh directory.\r\n  8. Test your connection to SourceForge:\r\n       ssh -l username projectname.sourceforge.net\r\n     Of course, substitute your SourceForge username and projectname for\r\n     username and projectname in the command above.\r\n  9. Accept the key from SourceForge, and when prompted, enter your \r\n     password for SourceForge.\r\n\r\n  If you have gotten this far, then SSH is now working and configured on\r\n  your system.\r\n\r\n  CVS setup:\r\n  1. Follow the instructions in the README file in the CVS distribution.\r\n\r\n  Optional steps (not necessary nor even necessarily advantageous):\r\n  2. On your user page at SourceForge, you should find a place to upload\r\n     your SSH public key.  Copy the file identity.pub into the text entry\r\n     box on the page -- be sure not to add any line breaks or it will not\r\n     work.\r\n  3. After the requisite 6 hour wait, you should be able to use CVS with\r\n     SSH without using your password.  Of course, under windows I still\r\n     haven\'t found a working ssh-agent for Win32, so you\'ll have to type\r\n     your passphrase instead -- since my passphrase is *much* longer than\r\n     my password, it\'s easier for me to use the password instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Importing your source code\r\n  At this point, you should be able to check in your source following the \r\n  instructions in the CVS documentation on SourceForge.\r\n\r\n  1. Switch to the root directory of your project on your local hard drive.\r\n  2. Check in the initial version of your software to CVS:\r\n       cvs -d:ext:username@cvs.projectname.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/projectname import directoryname vendor start\r\n     Substitute your username and projectname as before.  Directoryname is\r\n     the name of the new directory that will be created in your CVS\r\n     repository -- you\'ll probably want to use your project name for this\r\n     as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory:\r\nv0.3, 03-Jan-2000: Added &quot;:ext:&quot; to -d parameter for the cvs initial import.\r\n\r\nv0.2, 15-Dec-1999: Added missing HOME environment variable.\r\n\r\nv0.1, 15-Dec-1999: Initial version\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n',

It is possible\r\nthat Win9x will misbehave in new strange and wonderful ways!)\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Setting things up from scratch&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nLet us suppose you (with SourceForge username &quot;&lt;code&gt;your-username&lt;/code&gt;&quot;) have set\r\nSSH up successfully and are able to SSH to your SourceForge project (named\r\n&quot;&lt;code&gt;your-project&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.) You have also installed WinCVS, have started it up, and you want\r\nto get it to talk to your SourceForge CVS repository. This is not too difficult, although you might\r\nnot discover it straight away by trial and error.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Select CVS Admin-&gt;Preferences ...&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;In the \'General\' tab,\r\n &lt;ul&gt;\r\n &lt;li&gt;Set the \'CVSROOT\' to &quot;&lt;code&gt;:ext:your-username@cvs.your-project.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/your-project&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n &lt;li&gt;Set the \'Authentication\' to &quot;SSH Server&quot;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;In the \'Ports\' tab, set \'Check for an alternative rsh name\' to &quot;&lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;&quot;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nYou will be tempted now to try to log in using the CVS Admin-&gt;Login\r\noption; however, this will just result in a misleading error message,\r\n&quot;Set the password authentication first in the preferences !&quot; We\'ve\r\nset up our preferences just fine, password authentification works\r\ndifferently for an SSH server. So &lt;strong&gt;don\'t&lt;/strong&gt; use\r\nCVS Admin-&gt;Login.\r\n&lt;/p&gt; \r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nInstead, whenever you perform some CVS operation that requires authentification, WinCVS will invoke your SSH\r\nclient, albeit in a rather unhelpful way. The invocation of the SSH client is silent and may take a \r\nbit of time. Eventually (for me at least) it appears in a minimised blank DOS shell window and sits there silently\r\nwaiting for me to type in my SourceForge password without any echo... nonetheless it works if I do this.\r\nAfter a brief pause to authenticate WinCVS carries out its communications with the repository as usual.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt;Correcting an existing mess&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThis seems simple enough (if a little awkward!) but if you have experimented with the various other options, you may have\r\nalready fallen foul of a gotcha that certainly gotch me. If you optimistically set your CVSROOT instead to\r\n&lt;code&gt;:pserver:your-username@cvs.your-project.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/your-project&lt;/code&gt; and selected &quot;.passwd\r\nfile on the CVS server&quot; for \'Authentication\', you will have found to your delight that you can then use CVS Admin-&gt;Login...,\r\nand then enter your SourceForge password just the once, after which you can talk successfully to the repository, doing such\r\npleasant read-only things as checking out existing modules, updating them, and diffing your changes. However,\r\nWinCVS has trapped you and is giggling. You will find that when you come to commit your changes back to the repository\r\nfor everyone to play with, you will not be able to do so: you will hear the complaint \'&lt;code&gt;cvs [server aborted]: &quot;commit&quot; requires write\r\naccess to the repository&lt;/code&gt;\'.\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\nThe reason this can cause particular problems is that by this point, simply switching to the correct Preferences settings\r\ngiven above isn\'t enough. As a result of checking stuff out with different settings in place,\r\nyou now have lots of &lt;code&gt;CVS/Root&lt;/code&gt; metadata files that know the material they control was\r\nchecked out from a &lt;code&gt;:pserver:&lt;/code&gt; CVSROOT. As a result, even after changing your Preferences\r\nas required, WinCVS won\'t launch SSH and give you a chance to prove you have write permission since it thinks\r\nyou have already identified yourself; it will just continue to flake out with the &quot;...&lt;code&gt;requires write access&lt;/code&gt;...&quot;\r\ncomplaint. The simplest solution is to undo your crimes completely, and start again by checking the stuff out with the\r\ncorrect &lt;code&gt;:ext:&lt;/code&gt; CVSROOT. However, if you\'re feeling adventurous, you can edit all the existing\r\n&lt;code&gt;CVS/Root&lt;/code&gt; metadata files to achieve the same effect without compromising your existing\r\nchanges. (It worked for me - the resulting change to the files\' modification dates seemed to do no harm.)\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;dl&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;dt&gt;2000.07.07&lt;/dt&gt;\r\n&lt;dd&gt;\r\nAdded warning about not using CVS Admin-&gt;Login and clarification of\r\nSSH invocation - thanks &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:beman@esva.net&quot;&gt;Beman Dawes&lt;/a&gt;.\r\n&lt;/dd&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;dt&gt;2000.06.06&lt;/dt&gt;\r\n&lt;dd&gt;Original document submitted&lt;/dd&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;/dl&gt;\r\n',

It still tries to call ssh with parameter &quot;-b&quot; \r\n                    which is not understood by the os/2 port of ssh.

database, stores information in a number of tables.\r\nTables contain records, each of which represents a bit of information, shaped according to the format for that table.\r\nGo look up any book on SQL and see how simple it all is.&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;Particularly interesting are so-called &lt;EM&gt;keys&lt;/EM&gt;, which are unique values stored in a position of that database.\r\nIf these values are mentioned in a(nother) table in the database, they can be interpreted as a reference from one record to another, just like addresses serve as pointers in C and any of its crippled follow-ups.&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;Databases are simply structured and can therefore be put to just about any use you can think of.\r\nThey are particularly useful in being &lt;EM&gt;persistent&lt;/EM&gt;, that is, anything short of an atom bomb will not do to erase once-stored data.\r\nTo clearly mark the timing for this `once-stored\' notion, an important process concept in the database world is a &lt;EM&gt;transaction&lt;/EM&gt;, which is particularly useful when many users concurrently access the same database but wish to pretend they access it one at a time.&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;A NAME=&quot;mysql&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;What is MySQL?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\r\n&lt;/A&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;Ah, MySQL is a database... except that it\'s a &lt;EM&gt;crisp&lt;/EM&gt; database.\r\nSure, it\'s fairly accepted in the GNU/Linux world, so it must be good. \r\nBut &lt;EM&gt;why&lt;/EM&gt; is it so good?\r\nAnd why is it used so much more often under web services than that other, full-blown, Open Source database, PostgreSQL?&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;Basically, the people that made MySQL don\'t implement a complete relational database.\r\nThey\'re very close, but left out a few concepts that slow down a complete SQL implementation.\r\nThe result: A crisp database which is in most situations quite usable for web applications.&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;The MySQL people left out &lt;EM&gt;transactions&lt;/EM&gt;.\r\nThis means that it is not possible to imagine all database operations as happening in sequence, but since most interactions deal with a combination of tables iterated over once in one SQL statement, this is not a problem.\r\nTransactions get useful if you first perform one SQL statement to request information, then another to process it somehow.\r\nBe a little smarter in writing your SQL queries, and you\'ll do fine (mostly, that is).\r\nAnd in case of trouble, you are supposed to be able to lock tables, but I never needed it, so I cannot tell you how.&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;To avoid most chances of trouble with this lack of transactions, MySQL also doesn\'t allow you to nest one SQL query inside another.\r\nAnd that\'s the only true constraint on query expressiveness in MySQL --- But again, mostly you should be fine.&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;Without transactions, MySQL can be an incredible lot faster in SQL query processing than any database that does offer transaction support.&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;Without transactions, don\'t even think of e-commerce applications (don\'t think of it on SourceForge anyway, you promised to stay clear of such horrible habits).\r\nReason for not doing e-commerce with MySQL is that e-commerce usually requires &lt;EM&gt;distributed transactions&lt;/EM&gt;, that ensure that all parties (like you, your bank, the selling party, the selling bank, any intermediaries) all agree on the success of failure of the deal.\r\nWithout transactions, let alone distributed ones, you cannot expect this stuff to reliably go right.&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;Without transactions, there still are many SQL queries that may be utilised for all sorts of purposes on dynamic web pages and the underlying administration.\r\nSourceForge, for example, administers all its data in MySQL.\r\nHeck, you don\'t expect to need more complicated queries than those of SourceForge, do you?\r\nFor almost any purpose, MySQL fits the bill!&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- pgsql\r\n\r\n&lt;A NAME=&quot;pgsql&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;What is PostgreSQL?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\r\n&lt;/A&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;PostgreSQL is another relational database, completely Open Source this time.\r\nIt is a complete implementation of SQL (as far as I know) and in comparison to MySQL it adds transactions, even distributed transactions if you want.\r\nFor most purposes, MySQL will do, but for some...\r\nAnyway, I think you can even request a PostgreSQL database if you want to!&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n--&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;A NAME=&quot;request&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;How to request a database at SourceForge?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\r\n&lt;/A&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;Okay, remember the &lt;A HREF=&quot;faq.php#whyhost-root&quot;&gt;FAQ question&lt;/A&gt; whether it was a good thing not to have root access and that the reply by the SourceForge folks was that in return you get professional sysadmin services? Here\'s where that\'s absolutely true.\r\nYou don\'t have to (or want to) get into user administration of MySQL, it is a small disaster.\r\nBelieve me, you should be glad some experienced guy is doing it for you!&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;All you need to do is to request a database &lt;EM&gt;for your project&lt;/EM&gt; (so, be sure to mention its name) on the &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/support/?func=addsupport&amp;group_id=1&quot;&gt;request submission&lt;/A&gt; page of the &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/support/?group_id=1&quot;&gt;support pages&lt;/A&gt; of SourceForge.\r\nEnter a &quot;Database Server&quot; category query with a text like\r\n&lt;PRE&gt;\r\n        Hi!\r\n\r\n        Could you create a MySQL database for my project GeeksGoGroovy?\r\n\r\n        Thanx,\r\n        -ThisGeek.\r\n&lt;/PRE&gt;\r\n&lt;!-- pgsql\r\nThey\'ll even provide you with PostgreSQL if you want to, but the default is MySQL, because it\'s lighter and suitable for most purposes anyway.\r\n--&gt;\r\nAfter requesting your database, just wait a few days or so, and then an email should poor into your mailbox.&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;This email contains the hostname that runs your database, the username you should access the database with (not necessarily related to your SourceForge-login, but it usually equals your project name), the name of the database (usually also equals your project name) and a password.\r\nThe email therefore looks a bit like this:\r\n&lt;PRE&gt;\r\n        Hostname:       VAntastic\r\n        Database:       Dumpster\r\n        Username:       GeeksGoGroovy\r\n        Password:       Sekreet\r\n&lt;/PRE&gt;\r\nPlus the usual amount of geek wisdom at the bottom &lt;CODE&gt;;-)&lt;/CODE&gt;\r\nYou need this information to start up MySQL from your shell account at SourceForge:\r\n&lt;PRE&gt;\r\n        bash$ mysql -h VAntastic -u GeeksGoGroovy Dumpster -p\r\n        Password: Sekreet\r\n        Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or g.\r\n        Your MySQL connection id is 2 to server version: 3.22.30\r\n\r\n        Type \'help\' for help.\r\n\r\n        mysql&gt; \r\n&lt;/PRE&gt;\r\nAt the &lt;CODE&gt;mysql&gt;&lt;/CODE&gt; prompt, you may start entering SQl commands and end them with &lt;CODE&gt;;&lt;/CODE&gt; plus return.&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;For example, this is what you could do to create your first database table:\r\n&lt;PRE&gt;\r\n        create table goosebumps\r\n        ( id      integer not null,\r\n          country varchar(255),\r\n          monster varchar(255),\r\n          primary key (id)\r\n        );\r\n&lt;/PRE&gt;\r\nand more tables in a similar way.\r\nYou could inserted some entries in tables as follows:\r\n&lt;PRE&gt;\r\n        insert into goosebumps\r\n        values (1, \'Scotland\',     \'Nessy\'),\r\n               (2, \'USA\',          \'Bill\'),\r\n               (3, \'Transilvania\', \'Dracula\');\r\n&lt;/PRE&gt;\r\nWe\'ll use this data in the example in the next section, but you can query it here too, with SQL queries like:\r\n&lt;PRE&gt;\r\n        select country,monster\r\n        from goosebumps\r\n        where country&lt;&gt;\'USA\';\r\n&lt;/PRE&gt;\r\nWhen entered in MySQL, this prints the following table:\r\n&lt;PRE&gt;\r\n        +--------------+---------+\r\n        | country      | monster |\r\n        +--------------+---------+\r\n        | Scotland     | Nessy   |\r\n        | Transilvania | Dracula |\r\n        +--------------+---------+\r\n        2 rows in set (0.00 sec)\r\n&lt;/PRE&gt;\r\nbut of course, such layout is &lt;EM&gt;not dun&lt;/EM&gt; for commercial quality (find the contradiction) software, for which the following layout is often &lt;EM&gt;mission-critical&lt;/EM&gt;:\r\n&lt;UL&gt;\r\n&lt;TABLE BORDER=3&gt;\r\n&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH ALIGN=LEFT&gt;country&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;TH ALIGN=LEFT&gt;monster&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;\r\n&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Scotland&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Nessy&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;\r\n&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Transilvania&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Dracula&lt;/TD&gt;\r\n&lt;/TABLE&gt;\r\n&lt;/UL&gt;\r\nSo, we start wondering:&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;A NAME=&quot;php&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;How to access a database from a webpage?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\r\n&lt;/A&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;Let\'s get to some real work now!\r\nThe previous section explained how to log in.\r\nYour favourite SQL book taught you how to create tables and insert initial data into it.\r\nLet\'s assume this all worked.\r\n(And no, it\'s not a shame if you make typo\'s in SQL syntax, people once stared at me in utter amazement for extending a table with a new attribute in one try, just to demonstrate how average SQL queries are formed: by trial and error.)&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;Next to enjoying the pleasures of typing SQL commands manually and getting the results back in the format of tables that don\'t fit on a 80-char-wide terminal, there is the possibility to exploit PHP for this purpose.\r\nIt goes without saying that SourceForge provides PHP for anything you deem worthy, including even an &lt;CODE&gt;index.php&lt;/CODE&gt; entrance page instead of &lt;CODE&gt;index.html&lt;/CODE&gt;!&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;The PHP language is a server-side scripting language that can directly access a database, without the need of complicated web structures like &lt;CODE&gt;cgi-bin&lt;/CODE&gt; scripts.\r\nJust let your filenames end in &lt;CODE&gt;.php&lt;/CODE&gt; or perhaps in &lt;CODE&gt;.php3&lt;/CODE&gt; and the script is interpreted as PHP code.\r\nBasically, PHP is just HTML, but with the possibility (to name one of many) of intersecting dynamic sections of code, such as\r\n&lt;PRE&gt;\r\n        &lt;?php\r\n\r\n                echo &quot;&lt;BLINK&gt;This is blinking&lt;/BLINK&gt;&quot;;\r\n        ?&gt;\r\n&lt;/PRE&gt;\r\nor, of course, much more fancy material, such as database access.&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;These are the steps you need to take to access a database from PHP scripts:\r\n&lt;OL&gt;\r\n&lt;LI&gt; &lt;B&gt;Open a MySQL connection:&lt;/B&gt;\r\n        First, we need to establish a connection to the database on the host that runs the MySQL daemon.\r\n        In terms of PHP, this goes:\r\n        &lt;PRE&gt;\r\n        $db=mysql_connect (&quot;VAntastic&quot;, &quot;GeeksGoGroovy&quot;, &quot;Sekreet&quot;);\r\n        &lt;/PRE&gt;\r\n&lt;LI&gt; &lt;B&gt;Select your database:&lt;/B&gt;\r\n        There now is a connection to MySQL, but since many databases may reside at the contacted host, we should specify which one to use, just like we did with &lt;CODE&gt;-h&lt;/CODE&gt; on the command line; in PHP:\r\n        &lt;PRE&gt;\r\n        mysql_select_db (&quot;Dumpster&quot;, $db);\r\n        &lt;/PRE&gt;\r\n&lt;LI&gt; &lt;B&gt;Send an SQL query:&lt;/B&gt;\r\n        We first have to specify what we want to ask the database.\r\n        This is a plain query as you learned from your favourite SQL book, entered as a string.\r\n        In PHP, this goes:\r\n        &lt;PRE&gt;\r\n        $result=mysql_query (&quot;select country,monster from goosebumps&quot;, $db);\r\n        &lt;/PRE&gt;\r\n&lt;LI&gt; &lt;B&gt;Iterate over the rows:&lt;/B&gt;\r\n        The SQL query can return any number records, or in database terms, rows.\r\n        To deal with this generally, we should iterate over the rows in the result.\r\n        In PHP, this is done as follows:\r\n        &lt;PRE&gt;\r\n        while ($row=mysql_fetch_row ($result)) {\r\n            ... process $row ...\r\n        }\r\n        &lt;/PRE&gt;\r\n&lt;LI&gt; &lt;B&gt;Process each row:&lt;/B&gt;\r\n        Let\'s assume we lack any imagination, and just wish to print the data in the current row.\r\n        This can be done with a PHP statement like:\r\n        &lt;PRE&gt;\r\n        print (&quot;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;$row[0]&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;$row[1]&lt;/TD&gt;n&quot;);\r\n        &lt;/PRE&gt;\r\n&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;Close the deal:&lt;/B&gt;\r\n        Being good Un*x community citizens, we have learnt to clean up after we\'re done.\r\n        This habit is formulated in PHP with:\r\n        &lt;PRE&gt;\r\n        mysql_close ($db);\r\n        &lt;/PRE&gt;\r\n        provided, of course, that &lt;CODE&gt;isset($db)&lt;/CODE&gt; because otherwise, there was a fault in opening the database to start with.\r\n&lt;/OL&gt;\r\n&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;The whole PHP code with some table-embellishments now reads:\r\n&lt;PRE&gt;\r\n        &lt;?php\r\n\r\n        $db=mysql_connect (&quot;VAntastic&quot;, &quot;GeeksGoGroovy&quot;, &quot;Sekreet&quot;);\r\n        mysql_select_db (&quot;Dumpster&quot;, $db);\r\n        $result=mysql_query (&quot;select country,monster from goosebumps&quot;, $db);\r\n        print (&quot;&lt;TABLE BORDER=3&gt;n&quot;);\r\n        print (&quot;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH ALIGN=LEFT&gt;country&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;TH ALIGN=LEFT&gt;monster&lt;/TH&gt;n&quot;);\r\n        while ($row=mysql_fetch_row ($result)) {\r\n                print (&quot;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;$row[0]&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;$row[1]&lt;/TD&gt;n&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n        print (&quot;&lt;/TABLE&gt;n&quot;);\r\n        mysql_close ($db);\r\n        ?&gt;\r\n&lt;/PRE&gt;\r\nPut all of this in a &lt;CODE&gt;.php&lt;/CODE&gt; file in your project\'s &lt;CODE&gt;htdocs&lt;/CODE&gt;, for example &lt;CODE&gt;/home/groups/GeeksGoGroovy/htdocs/tralala.php&lt;/CODE&gt; and access its webpage &lt;CODE&gt;http://GeeksGoGroovy.sourceforge.net/tralala.php&lt;/CODE&gt; to see the results.\r\nThat\'s all there is to it!&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;A NAME=&quot;tips&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Tips and Tricks&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\r\n&lt;/A&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;\r\nOnce your database runs, find out how you can make one table refer to another (or to itself, for that matter) by naming the &lt;EM&gt;primary key&lt;/EM&gt; in an attribute, much like you would use a pointer in a programming language.\r\nYou can pass those around between PHP scrips by generating references like &lt;CODE&gt;&lt;A HREF=&quot;HallOfGeeks.php?country=USA&quot;&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/CODE&gt; that pass a &lt;CODE&gt;country&lt;/CODE&gt; parameter to the PHP script &lt;CODE&gt;HallOfGeeks.php&lt;/CODE&gt;, that can use it as a normal variable, like in\r\n&lt;PRE&gt;\r\n        $result=mysql_query (&quot;select country,monster from goosebumps\r\n                                        where country=\'$country\'&quot;, $db);\r\n&lt;/PRE&gt;\r\nwhere you should mind the different use of quotes!&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;If you don\'t want to pass around numbers, but prefer names, you should encode according to the HTTP standards for a URL, to handles spaces and so on well.\r\nDo this with the PHP function &lt;CODE&gt;urlencode&lt;/CODE&gt; as follows:\r\n&lt;PRE&gt;\r\n        echo &quot;&amp;lt;A HREF=\'HallOfGeeks.php?search=&quot;, urlencode($plaintext), &quot;\'&amp;gt;&quot;;\r\n&lt;/PRE&gt;\r\nto turn a string &amp;lt;CODE&amp;gt\'n*s&lt;/CODE&amp;gt; into a reference like\r\n&lt;PRE&gt;\r\n        &amp;lt;A HREF=\'HallOfGeeks.php?search=n%25s\'&amp;gt;\r\n&lt;/PRE&gt;\r\nThe asterisk is automatically recovered from these codes when PHP parses its script parameters.&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;Parameters can be treated as optional.\r\nConsider this code as a replacement of the previous:\r\n&lt;PRE&gt;\r\n        $cc=&quot;&quot;;\r\n        if (isset ($search)) {\r\n                $cc=&quot; and monster regexp \'$search\'&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n        $result=mysql_query (&quot;select country,monster from goosebumps\r\n                                        where country=\'$country\'\r\n                                        $cc&quot;, $db);\r\n&lt;/PRE&gt;\r\nThis would add the new constraint only when the variable is defined; the variable will be defined if it occurs as a parameter to the script.&lt;/P&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;One last tip: It is possible to make pages &lt;EM&gt;very&lt;/EM&gt; dynamic.\r\nIf a browsing person visits the same page several times, make sure that it is clear what the goal for that page is.\r\nThere is no problem in using login interactions when a browsers accesses a privileged page, as long as it can eventually lead to the page longed for.\r\nThis lesson helped me to drastically improve the web structure of the LHSD project.&lt;/P&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;Do you see how quick and easy this combination of MySQL+PHP works?\r\nThat\'s what I meant before with crispness of this stuff!\r\nPerhaps your fingers are starting to itch a tad bit?\r\nLook at the URLs in SourceForge, and it\'ll only get worse &lt;CODE&gt;:-)&lt;/CODE&gt;\r\n&lt;BR&gt;\r\n&lt;EM&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;A NAME=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;References&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\r\n&lt;/A&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;\r\n&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;SourceForge&lt;/A&gt;

        '  &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Introduction&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;Hello new SourceForge user ! I\'m writing this HOWTO in\r\nan effort to make it easier to setup a new project at SourceForge. This\r\ndocument is incomplete, (of course) and will hopefully be added to over\r\ntime as more features are added to SourceForge. My intention is for this\r\nto be a step-by-step guide for the initial setup of your new project. First\r\nI will outline what I think is the most common situation new developers\r\nwill face ; You have a directory of code, maybe even a current CVS repository,\r\nand you wish to use all the features of SourceForge to continue developing\r\nyour project in the public eye, free, and open sourced, and hopefully to\r\nattract some new developers to it, and, of course, users. So let\'s get\r\nstarted...\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=+2&gt;Steps for setting up a new project&lt;/FONT&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;Here is a brief overview of what is involved, details\r\nto follow ;\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;1. Register as a new user with SourceForge.\r\n&lt;BR&gt;2. Register a New Project, logged in as the user you\r\ncreated in step 1.\r\n&lt;BR&gt;3. Setup your group and project information.\r\n&lt;BR&gt;4. Create your CVS repository with the latest snapshot\r\nof your code.\r\n&lt;BR&gt;5. Setup your group\'s web site.\r\n&lt;BR&gt;6. Setup mailing lists for your project.\r\n&lt;BR&gt;7. Finally, get used to using CVS for development, and\r\nget to work !&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;...and some other things that you may need ;\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Release a file module so people can see your work !\r\n&lt;BR&gt;9. Read the SourceForge site documentation and the help\r\nmessage forums.&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT SIZE=+2&gt;Now on to the business...&lt;/FONT&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;1. Register as a new user with SourceForge.&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;On the &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;SourceForge\r\nhomepage&lt;/A&gt;, click on the option New User via SSL. This will allow you\r\nto give your details to SourceForge, and it will then setup a user account\r\nfor you. To do just about anything involving interacting with SourceForge\r\nyou need to have a user account. Once this is done, you can login as this\r\nuser anytime using the Login via SSL option on the SourceForge homepage.\r\n&lt;P&gt;When you login you are presented with your personal page\r\n; any projects you are involved in are listed, along with some other info.\r\nAlong the side of the page are some options for you, including one which\r\nis of particular interest to us ; Register New Project...\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Register a New Project, logged in as the user you created\r\nin step 1.&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;Clicking on the Register New Project link takes you to\r\na set of pages which you must simply step through, providing all the information\r\nrequired. It is very straightforward and well setup, so no help here is\r\nreally needed\r\n&lt;P&gt;Once complete, it gets sent to the SourceForge staff,\r\nand they look over it to determine if your project would be suited to the\r\ngoals of SourceForge. I\'ve yet to hear of a project rejected, so don\'t\r\nworry ; if its open sourced and free, I think you\'ll get accepted quickly&lt;P&gt;Now you wait, and hopefully receive a reply within 24\r\nhours. (if it takes longer, mail them directly - there were some problems\r\nwith new projects, but I believe they have been corrected now) If all goes\r\nwell you will be informed of your new project being up, and so login via\r\nSSL and at the bottom of your personal page there will be a link to your\r\nnew project\'s group page\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Setup your group and project information.&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;Click on that link ! You will now see your group\'s SourceForge\r\npage (this is different from your web site), and a list of options allowing\r\nyou to change things,  basically to administer your project.\r\n&lt;P&gt;What do you have now ? Well, you have all of the following\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;a website at http://yourproject.sourceforge.net\r\n&lt;li&gt;a CVS repository at &lt;li&gt;cvs.yourproject.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/yourproject\r\n&lt;li&gt;anonymous FTP at yourproject.sourceforge.net,\r\n&lt;li&gt;and access to mailing lists, which we\'ll use later.\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;The first thing to do is to enter a description of your\r\nproject for your group page. Click on Project Admin, and then on Edit Group\r\npublic Information and Categorization. Insert the required info into the\r\nfields.\r\n&lt;P&gt;Next question ; Do you have any other developers already\r\n? If so, they must all register as users on SourceForge, and then give\r\nyou their user names. You can then add them by user name to your list of\r\ndevelopers, giving them write access to your group\'s CVS and web site.\r\nTo do this go back to Project Admin, and click on Add Group Member. Now\r\ntype in their user name, and they will be added.\r\n&lt;P&gt;The rest of your group page you can explore and see what\r\nelse is about. I think  we\'ve done the most important things here.\r\nTime to get some code where everyone can see it...\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Create your CVS repository with the latest snapshot\r\nof your code.&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;For people new to internet development (as I am myself)\r\nCVS takes a little getting used to. For the newbies, here is a brief description\r\nof what it does and how ;\r\n&lt;P&gt;It keeps a record of every change made to the source code,\r\nalong with comments about that change. At any time you can see any previous\r\nversion of any file in the repository. It allows multiple people to work\r\non the same files at the same time, merging the changes as they are &quot;committed&quot;,\r\nand alarming the user if two changes conflict (very clearly, I might add)\r\nmaking sure the difference is resolved by a human being before allowing\r\nthe new version of that file to be placed into the repository.\r\n&lt;P&gt;This is cool. It takes some getting used to however. Basically\r\nthe development cycle goes like this ;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;You import all your code into the CVS, then everyone\r\n&quot;checks out&quot; a working copy of the source tree.\r\n&lt;li&gt;Each person works in the comfort of their own computer\r\ngenerated reality, and when they have a new feature working, they &quot;update&quot;\r\ntheir local copy to be as much in sync with the current version as possible,\r\nand then they &quot;commit&quot; the files that have changed, back into the repository.\r\n&lt;li&gt;Any problems CVS has with commiting the files will\r\nbe mentioned, and you must then go through the problem files and resolve\r\nthe differences manually. In the files, the changed section is highlighted\r\nwith &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and both versions are shown. Simply delete the old version (or\r\nedit to make it work how its supposed to), and re-commit the file. Once\r\nCVS has no problem, return to step (2), and get back to work !\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;So, now to the details of importing your source tree into\r\nyour CVS repository at SourceForge. First read the site documentation on\r\nCVS. For more info read a bit of the free 180 page &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://cvsbook.red-bean.com&quot;&gt;CVS\r\nbook&lt;/A&gt;. Then do the following ;\r\n&lt;P&gt;Get &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.ssh.fi&quot;&gt;SSH&lt;/A&gt; and CVS for your\r\nplatform. Under linux using a Bash shell, type in the following ;\r\n&lt;P&gt;export CVS_RSH=ssh\r\n&lt;BR&gt;export CVSROOT=loginname@cvs.yourproject.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/yourproject\r\n&lt;P&gt;The first line tells CVS to use SSH to connect to the\r\nrepository. This is for security purposes. The second line tells CVS where\r\nto look for its Repository.\r\n&lt;P&gt;Now, the most likely situation is that you have some source\r\ncode in a directory tree you wish to import into CVS. Go to the top directory\r\nyou wish to import, in your source code tree, and type in the following,\r\nfilling in the bits mentioned below ;\r\n&lt;P&gt;cvs import directoryname vendor start\r\n&lt;P&gt;directoryname is the name under which the repository\r\nwill be accessed. If all goes well it will ask for your SourceForge user\r\npassword, and then go on its merry way importing your whole source tree.\r\n&lt;P&gt;Next, backup your old code base somewhere, because you\r\ndon\'t want to work with it anymore, and checkout a fresh CVS version using\r\n;\r\n&lt;P&gt;cvs checkout directoryname\r\n&lt;P&gt;This will get you a &quot;working copy&quot; of the code, in CVS\r\nform, ready for you to hack on. You should remember, however, that any\r\nchanges such as adding/removing files and directories must be explicitly\r\nstated to CVS - see the above mentioned book for details.\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Setup your group\'s web site.&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;I\'ll assume that you have some sort of web page or site\r\nbuilt already that you wish to put up on SourceForge to give your group\r\na public face. Login to SourceForge using SSH, for example ;\r\n&lt;P&gt;ssh -l loginname yourproject.sourceforge.net\r\n&lt;P&gt;you will now be in your home directory. From here all\r\ngroup files are stored in /home/groups/yourproject. Change to this\r\ndirectory. All your web pages are stored in the htdocs directory. Going\r\nin here will contain index.php, which is a blank page that says you haven\'t\r\nuploaded a web page yet. Logout, and copy the files for your web page using\r\nscp, a program which comes with ssh. For example ;\r\n&lt;P&gt;scp localfile   loginname@shell.sourceforge.net:/home/groups/yourproject/htdocs\r\n&lt;P&gt;I suggest you gzip up your site, send it in one go using\r\nscp, then login with ssh and gunzip it.\r\n&lt;P&gt;So what should be on the web page ? Perhaps you\'d like\r\nthe following, as well as your project\'s information ;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;A link to the projects group page on SourceForge.\r\n&lt;li&gt;Mailing list links (we\'ll create them in a second)\r\n&lt;li&gt;A SourceForge icon and web counter - see the site\r\ndocumentation for this.\r\n&lt;li&gt;A link to the CVS web interface at http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/?cvsroot=yourproject\r\n&lt;li&gt;Some info about using CVS specific to your project.\r\n&lt;li&gt;Setup mailing lists for your project.&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;If your project isn\'t that active yet (or only has one\r\nlonely developer) your mailing lists will be very quiet, however I still\r\nsuggest you look to the future and setup three standard lists for your\r\nproject ; a devel list for developers, a users list for users, and an announce\r\nlist for new version announcements.\r\n&lt;P&gt;Do this via your group page using the mailing list admin\r\nlink. Its quite simple so you shouldn\'t have any problems...\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Finally, get used to using CVS for development, and\r\nget to work !&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;I\'ll give you some quick details of the development cycle\r\nto get you started, but anything you\'ll have to look up yourself.\r\n&lt;P&gt;To update your working copy to be in sync with the CVS\r\nrepository one use ;\r\n&lt;P&gt;cvs -z3 update -Pd\r\n&lt;P&gt;(after setting up CVSROOT and CVS_RSH as outline previously)\r\n&lt;BR&gt;For commiting the changes to a file ;\r\n&lt;P&gt;cvs commit -m &quot;comment about changes.&quot; filename\r\n&lt;P&gt;To add a new file to the CVS repository ;\r\n&lt;P&gt;cvs add filename\r\n&lt;BR&gt;cvs commit -m &quot;added filename&quot; filename\r\n&lt;P&gt;...and now you\'re ready to go !\r\n&lt;P&gt;Some other things that you may need ;\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Release a file module so people can see your work !&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Read the SourceForge site documentation and the help\r\nmessage forums.&lt;/b&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;From the homepage.

This will include any official released versions of their\r\nsource code, in any format. \r\n&lt;P&gt;\r\nBefore releasing files, you must first define a file module for your project. If your project has only one development tree, you will probably define only\r\none module. If your project will be releasing multiple filesets, then additional modules may be defined. \r\n&lt;P&gt;\r\nA file module defines an actual software product. When other projects choose to make references to your products, for dependencies or other\r\nreasons, it is your file modules that will be referenced. For this reason, when a file module is defined, it cannot be deleted in case it is referenced\r\nspecifically by other parts of the site. \r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;\r\nIMPORTANT! \r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\nFile modules are always referenced through their parent project.

These two files were always dependent upon eachother, would always have the same set of developers, and would never be\r\nseparated. They would have been two modules under one project in SourceForge. \r\n',

In the following we assume the most simple case:\r\n\r\n&lt;UL&gt;\r\n&lt;LI&gt; Your project is &lt;B&gt;foo&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;LI&gt; It has a &lt;B&gt;File Module&lt;/B&gt; named &lt;B&gt;foo&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;LI&gt; You want to show &lt;B&gt;foo-2.0.tar.gz&lt;/B&gt; in the &lt;B&gt;File Release&lt;/B&gt; box.\r\n&lt;/UL&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Uploading to download.sourceforge.net&lt;/B&gt;&lt;P&gt;\r\n\r\nThe interactive method would be:\r\n\r\n&lt;UL&gt;\r\n&lt;LI&gt; ftp download.sourceforge.net\r\n&lt;LI&gt; user: ftp\r\n&lt;LI&gt; password: me@myself.org\r\n&lt;LI&gt; cd incoming\r\n&lt;LI&gt; bin\r\n&lt;LI&gt; put foo-2.0.tar.gz\r\n&lt;/UL&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;\r\n\r\nThe command line method would be:\r\n\r\n&lt;UL&gt;\r\n&lt;LI&gt; ncftpput -V download.sourceforge.net /incoming foo-2.0.tar.gz\r\n&lt;/UL&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Accept the new release&lt;/B&gt;&lt;P&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;UL&gt;\r\n&lt;LI&gt; Login as administrator of project &lt;B&gt;foo&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;LI&gt; Go to the &lt;B&gt;foo&lt;/B&gt; project home page\r\n&lt;LI&gt; Click on &lt;B&gt;File Release&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;LI&gt; A popup menu shows all the files in the ftp://download.sourceforge.net/incoming/\r\n     area. Choose your file. Be very carefull not to choose the distribution of \r\n     someone else. \r\n&lt;LI&gt; Click on &lt;B&gt;Submit&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;/UL&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Fill information about the release&lt;/B&gt;&lt;P&gt;\r\n\r\nAlthough you should be carefull when filling these fields, you will \r\nhave the opportunity to fix mistakes later. \r\n\r\n&lt;UL&gt;\r\n&lt;LI&gt; Filling the version number is mandatory. In our example we\r\n     put &lt;B&gt;2.0&lt;/B&gt; in the &lt;B&gt;Release Version Number&lt;/B&gt; input box.\r\n&lt;LI&gt; Unless you want another date than the current date, leave the\r\n     &lt;B&gt;Release Date&lt;/B&gt; input box empty. \r\n&lt;LI&gt; If your project contains more than one File Module, you must \r\n     chose the one to which the release belongs. When handling a \r\n     simple project like &lt;B&gt;foo&lt;/B&gt; you have only one file module\r\n     named &lt;B&gt;foo&lt;/B&gt; and it is automatically selected. We leave\r\n     the &lt;B&gt;Module Name&lt;/B&gt; popup menu untouched for our example.\r\n&lt;LI&gt; The &lt;B&gt;Text Display Format&lt;/B&gt; checkbox choose the display \r\n     format of the ChangeLog and Release Notes text. \r\n&lt;LI&gt; The &lt;B&gt;Release Notes&lt;/B&gt; text area is intended for compatibility\r\n     information and synthetic description of the modifications. Basically\r\n     it should be formated as a mail the users of the project would like\r\n     to receive to know what\'s new in this release.\r\n&lt;LI&gt; The &lt;B&gt;ChangeLog&lt;/B&gt; text area is intended for chronologicaly ordered\r\n     technical change reports. It is intended for developpers to understand\r\n     precisely what happened to the sources since the latest release. Be\r\n     carefull: this box is not intended to contain the &lt;b&gt;full&lt;/b&gt; ChangeLog\r\n     content, only the diffs from the previous release.\r\n&lt;LI&gt; Click on the &lt;B&gt;Submit&lt;/B&gt; button.\r\n&lt;/UL&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Modifying release information&lt;/B&gt;&lt;P&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;UL&gt;\r\n&lt;LI&gt; Login as administrator of project &lt;B&gt;foo&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;LI&gt; Go to the &lt;B&gt;foo&lt;/B&gt; project home page\r\n&lt;LI&gt; Click on &lt;B&gt;Project Admin&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;LI&gt; Click on &lt;B&gt;Edit File Releases&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;LI&gt; Choose the release for which you want to update information and\r\n     click on the &lt;B&gt;Edit&lt;/B&gt; next to it.\r\n&lt;LI&gt; The &lt;B&gt;File Status&lt;/B&gt; popup menu allows you to delete a release.\r\n&lt;LI&gt; The &lt;B&gt;Filename&lt;/B&gt; input box allows you to change the filename \r\n     to which the release is related. Mainly usefull to fix mistakes.\r\n&lt;LI&gt; All the other fields are identical to the initial information form.\r\n&lt;LI&gt; Click on &lt;B&gt;Submit&lt;/B&gt;\r\n&lt;/UL&gt;\r\n\r\n',

First, it drives\r\ntraffic to SourceForge, and ultimately back to the Open Source\r\nprojects that we host. SourceForge has a lot of potential for\r\n&quot;cross linking&quot; many OpenSource projects, and the logo display\r\nfacilitates this.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;Second, when the logo is displayed, a log entry is generated\r\nfor your project that allows us to track hits to each of our hosted\r\nprojects. This information will be compiled and presented to\r\nour users in &quot;top&quot; activity lists for hosted projects. This will\r\nalso help us to identify projects that may require additional hosting\r\nresources due to large amounts of activity. \r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;Please use the following URL to place the graphic on your page:\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;http://sourceforge.net/sflogo.php?group_id=0&amp;type=1&lt;/B&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;In anchor and image tags, this would appear as follows:\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;lt;A href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net&quot;&amp;gt;\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&amp;lt;IMG src=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/sflogo.php?group_id=0&amp;type=1&quot;\r\n\r\nwidth=&quot;88&quot; height=&quot;31&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;SourceForge Logo&quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/A&amp;gt;\r\n&lt;/B&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Important!&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Substitute the number after &quot;group_id&quot;\r\n(currently 0)\r\nwith your own project/group number, which is displayed at the top\r\nof your project page on SourceForge.\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;This is the image that we now display:\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;IMG src=&quot;/sflogo.php?group_id=873&amp;type=1&quot;\r\nwidth=&quot;88&quot; height=&quot;31&quot; alt=&quot;SourceForge Logo&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;P&gt;Please email &lt;A href=&quot;mailto:staff@sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;staff@sourceforge.net&lt;/A&gt;\r\nwith any questions you may have.',
